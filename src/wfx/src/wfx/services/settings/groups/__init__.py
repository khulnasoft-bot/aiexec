"""Logical groupings of Primeagent settings.

Each module defines a ``BaseModel`` mixin that owns a cohesive subset of fields
plus their intra-group validators. They are composed into the final
``Settings`` class in :mod:`wfx.services.settings.base`.

Mixins inherit from ``BaseModel`` (not ``BaseSettings``) and are not intended
to be instantiated directly.
