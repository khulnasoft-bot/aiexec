"""Update the canonical ``wfx`` package (and its SDK dep) for nightly builds.

The nightly publishes ``wfx`` and ``primeagfent-sdk`` under their CANONICAL names as ``.devN``
pre-releases -- it does NOT rename them to ``wfx-nightly`` / ``primeagfent-sdk-nightly``, and it does
NOT give the ``src/bundles/*`` packages their own nightly track. The stable ``wfx-*`` bundles
(pinning ``wfx>=X.Y.0,<(X+1).0.0``) then resolve against the single canonical ``wfx`` distribution,
so there is no ``wfx`` vs ``wfx-nightly`` install collision. See ``src/bundles/NIGHTLY.md``.

This script therefore only (a) sets ``wfx``'s version to the nightly ``.devN`` and (b) re-pins
wfx's ``primeagfent-sdk`` dependency to the exact canonical dev version.
